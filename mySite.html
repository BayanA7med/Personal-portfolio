<!-- I am a fresh graduate from Bethlehem University with a bachelor's
degree in Software Engineering.I underwent training as a front-end React developer, mastering the fundamentals in JavaScript, HTML,
             and CSS during my internship at ASAL Company, Additionally, I familiarized myself with Git tools.
              Moreover, I gained a foundational understanding of  ReactJs and React Native. Furthermore, 
              I completed a weather map project capable of displaying weather information for user-specified 
              regions marked by pins on the map. Additionally, the project allows marking any area on the map 
              without requiring the region's name input.Additionally,  
            I completed a mobile application to connect students with the best private teachers and organize meetings between them. -->
